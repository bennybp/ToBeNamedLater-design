| Description:   | The brand of the module library           |
| Status:        | In development                            |


## Purpose

A name says a lot about a project and this proposal is all about what
the name and logo should be.

## Current Status

The project is now officially named Pulsar.  A logo is still needed.

## Previous Statuses

At the moment this project is being referred to as "bpmodule" or "the
module project" until some consensus has been reached.  Obviously this
does not represent an accaptable solution.


## Name Proposals

* **Pluginplay** (a play on "plug-and-play" (PnP) computer hardware concept
  * Domain is open
  * Ben and Lori both think it doesn't represent the chemistry/QM applications
  * People (and search engines) may confuse it for "plug-and-play"
* **Quasar**
  * Attempts to backronym:
    * Q=quantum 
    * U=utilities 
    * A=advancing,aiding
    * S=science 
    * A=at
    * R=Runtime,research
* **Pulsar**
  * Attempts to backronym: 
    * P=plugin
    * U=utilities
    * L=library, linking
    * S=Science
    * A=at, advancing
    * R=Runtime,research
