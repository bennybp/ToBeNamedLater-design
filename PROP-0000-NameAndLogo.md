| Description:   | The brand of the module library           |
| Status:        | In development                            |


## Purpose
A name says a lot about a project and this proposal is all about what the name and logo should be.

## Current Status

At the moment this project is being referred to as "bpmodule" or "the module project" until some consensus has been reached.  Obviously this does not represent an accaptable solution.

## Proposed Names
* PluginPlay (a play on the old "plug-and-play" computer hardware concept and the fact that modules are "plugins")

## Discussion
Pluginplay is currently Ryan's forerunner; however, Ben and Lori both agree that it doesn't represent the chemistry/QM applications of the project.
