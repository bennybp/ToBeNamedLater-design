## Purpose

## Recommendations
 * Test, test, then test some more
 * Test in small units
   * As many functions of a class that make sense
 * **Test failures as well as successes**. The unit should fail if it is expected to fail with the given inputs.
   * Bad options, etc 
 * Did I mention, test a lot?
