# ToBeNamedLater-design

This repository contains design documents related to what is currently being called "the module project".  The goals of the project are:

1. Provide a uniform top-level interface conducive to contributions from multiple groups and developers through encapsulation.
2. Provide a mid-level set of tools that allow new theories to be developed and tested in a minimal amount of time.
3. Provide a low-level set of core libraries that are highly optimized and parallelized to ensure the entire project performs well.

There are many facets to this undertaking and the point of this repo is to organize developers thoughts and to propose new ideas.  Discussion regarding design philosophies and ultimately standards is encouraged.  As the project evolves it is the intention that these design documents will naturally form the bulk of a programmers manual.
